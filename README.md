# 游꼙 zitrus

3DS homebrew library written entirely in zig.

![bitmap example in a 2ds](https://github.com/GasInfinity/zitrus/blob/main/docs/images/bitmap-2ds.png?raw=true)

## Installation

```bash
# Version that supports zig 0.14.1
zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/GasInfinity/zitrus
```

Then add this to your `build.zig`:
```zig
const zitrus_dep = b.dependency("zitrus", .{});
const zitrus_mod = zitrus_dep.module("zitrus");
// zitrus also exports the module `zitrus-tooling` which contains code useful outside of a homebrew environment (3DSX, SMDH, PICA200 shader asm, etc...)

// You must use the same target as `zitrus_mod`
const exe_mod = b.createModule(.{
    .root_source_file = b.path("src/your_main.zig"),
    .target = zitrus_mod.resolved_target,
    .optimize = optimize,
});

exe_mod.addImport("zitrus", zitrus_mod);

const exe = zitrus.addExecutable(b, .{
    .name = "homebrew.elf",
    .root_module = exe_mod,
});

// You can skip installing the elf but it is recommended to keep it for debugging purposes
b.installArtifact(exe);

const homebrew_smdh = zitrus.addMakeSmdh(b, .{
    .name = "homebrew.smdh",
    .settings = b.path("path-to-smdh-settings.ziggy"), // look at any demo for a quick example or the schema in tools/make-smdh/settings.ziggy-schema
    .icon = b.path("path-to-icon.png/jpg/..."), // supported formats depends on zigimg image decoding
});

// This step will convert your executable to 3dsx (the defacto homebrew executable format) to execute it in an emulator or real 3DS
const final_3dsx = zitrus.addMake3dsx(b, .{ .name = "homebrew.3dsx", .exe = exe, .smdh = homebrew_smdh });
b.getInstallStep().dependOn(&b.addInstallBinFile(final_3dsx, "homebrew.3dsx").step);
```

## Examples / Demos
Currently there are 3 examples in the `demo/` directory, only basic software blitting is implemented for graphics and we're missing almost all the services:
- [panic](demo/panic/) is a simple example that panics when opened to test panics and traces.
- [info](demo/info) is a simple app that currently shows the console region and model (will be updated to show more info over time).
- [bitmap](demo/bitmap/) is a port of the bitmap example in libctru's 3ds-examples.
- [flappy](demo/flappy) is a simple fully functional flappy bird clone written entirely with software blitting.

## Why?
I wanted to learn arm and always wanted to develop 3DS homebrew, also I searched and I haven't found any kind of zig package that doesn't use libctru, so I just started reading a lot and doing things. Furthermore, using only zig has a lot of advantages:
- Really simplified and easy development. You don't need complex toolchains, you just need the `zig` executable, that's it! (However, obviously it is recommended that you use devkitPRO's tools as I'm sure you'll need them. You want to use gdb, don't you?)
- Safety in `Debug` and `ReleaseSafe` modes. Zitrus currently uses the `ErrDisp` port to report panics and returned errors. The only missing thing is reporting return traces with debugging symbols (Currently only addresses are logged)
- Really useful and simple build-system (as you've seen the example `build.zig` is really small and makefiles are really arcane)

# Tooling coverage
- 游릭 smdh creation (tools/smdh)
- 游리 elf -> 3dsx conversion (tools/3dsx)
- 游리 PICA200 shader assembler/disassembler:
    - 游릭 Instruction encoding/decoding
    - 游리 Assembler/disassembler
- NCCH:
    - 游릭 ExeFS
    - 游댮 RomFS
    - 游댮 elf -> ExeFS .code
- 游댮 Everything not listed here
- 游댮 Dumping, a.k.a: 3dsx/exefs --> bin/elf, smdh -> config + icons, etc... (Reverse engineering mainly, lowest priority overall)

# HOS Coverage
Zitrus is currently very work in progress, it's able to run basic homebrew but lots of things are missing (services, ports, syscalls, io, etc...)

游릭 Fully implemented
游리 Partially implemented
游댮 Implementation not started/missing critical things

## Runtime support
- 游릭 crt0/startup code
- 游리 Panic and error reporting and tracing
- 游댮 std coverage/byos for io and some other useful things.

## Gpu Support

- 游릭 Software rendering with Framebuffers
- 游댮 GX Commands
- 游댮 2D/3D Acceleration (a.k.a: REALLY using the Gpu to do things)

## Port/Service Support

- 游리 `srv:`
- 游릭 `err:f`
- 游리 `APT:S/A/U`
- 游리 `hid:SPRV/USER`
- 游리 `cfg:u/s/i`
- 游리 `gsp::Gpu`
- 游댮 All other [services](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Services_API) not listed here

# Credits
- [3dbrew](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Main_Page) is seriously the best resource if you need info about the 3DS hardware/software
- @devkitPro for the tooling, a starting point/reference for this project and reference for unknown/undocumented/unspecified things (e.g: libctru and how tf jumping to home menu worked).
- @azahar-emu/[azahar](https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar) for providing an emulator to quickly test changes and the initial iterations.
- @LumaTeam/[Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/) for literally saving my life when trying to debug things in my 2DS.
